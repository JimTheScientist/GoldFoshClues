BREAKING NEWS.. This stunning, totally hand made 18carat gold fish sculpture set throughout with diamonds and vari coloured sapphires COULD BE YOURS, and this is how …. Tomorrow, You Tuber and comedian Max Fosh (who is performing at the Edinburgh Festival right now) will be singing a song on his channel and within the lyrics will be clues to where you will be able to find this goldfish. Max got together with his goldsmith mate he has known since they were boys, Sam Hunter, and came up with the idea of creating a treasure hunt inspired by the book Masquerade written in 1979 by Kit Williams which concealed clues to the location of finding a jewelled hare. Apparently a professional treasure hunter writer was commissioned by Max for this hunt .. how cool is that job ! I was asked by Sam to view his handiwork before it was buried. Sam is an exceptional goldsmith having won many GCDC awards and having been an apprentice for 6 years in Hatton Garden through the Goldsmiths Company. He then worked for Theo Fennell and now has his own workshop in the Goldsmith’s Centre. In the next post I will show you how it was made. Sam’s attention to detail is second to none and what particularly blew me away was the tail of the fish, as it has no front or back as the back holes are on both sides with the diamonds and sapphires set alternating front and back. If you get what I mean .. I always look to see if the back is as good as the front and in this case it’s the perfect example of the back being the front. It has the jubilee hallmark along with Sam’s maker’s mark and signature… absolutely fabulous craftsmanship and I don’t use those words lightly. I only hope the person who finds it will treasure it and even allow it to be on display somewhere for everyone to have the opportunity of seeing it … GOOD LUCK EVERYONE and I for one will be tuning in to Max Fosh’s You Tube channel tomorrow. @max.fosh @samhunterjewellery @gsmithscentre @thegoldsmithscompany #treasurehunt #craftsmanship #sapphires #gold #diamonds #finderskeepers @theassayoffice @gcdcawards
