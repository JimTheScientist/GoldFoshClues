# Lyrics + (Lyrical Video)

## Analysis

Let the direction of the goldfosh, when the clue starts *i.e.* to the right of the screen be 180°. Rest of the measurements said in this video will be based upon this axiom.

1. Max is holding the trout with his **left** hand.
2. Max has his right hand in his pocket.
3. He has a silver watch on his left hand ([see more about the watch here](/lyrics/watch.md)).
4. 5 + 1 on his cuff; [see more here](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/361625045086158560/) buttons on his shirt are visible.

```
"In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish"
```
Troutangle ≈225°

On the end of the word **fosh**:

1. The video **cuts** (or rather zooms) into a more zoomed prespective.
2. 2 + 1 button hidden by the subtitles can be seen.
```
That’s all you need to spout
```
Troutangle ≈225°

```
Exactly who to ask and how?
```
Troutangle ≈240°


```
Just use my vid to find out
```
Troutangle ≈240°


The trout turns to ≈270°
```
To claim the precious trout
```
Trout's are freshwater fishes. (*i.e.* they live in ponds, lakes, rivers, streams etc). Goldfishe's are carps, who are also freshwater fishes. Hence, **freshwater** may be important.

On the word: **trout**

1. The video **cuts** and the golfosh is now being held with his **right** hand and being only touched by the left. It looks like the goldfosh has been transferred from one hand to another.
2. His watch disappears.
3. The trout seems to be at ≈265°
4. 4 + 1 button hidden by the subtitles + 2 on his cuff can be seen.

```
Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen
```
Troutangle ≈265°

```
With the possibility the world is packed
```
Troutangle ≈260°

```
But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max
```
Troutangle ≈260°

```
And that’s beyond a fact
```
Troutangle ≈180°

On the word: **fact**

1. The video **cuts** and the golfosh is now being held with his **left** hand, with no support from its left.
2. The goldfish is now inverted, *i.e.* by our axiom, at ≈0°
3. His watch is still gone

```
Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice
```
Troutangle ≈45°

```
Post on TikTok videos?
```
Troutangle ≈45°

```
No need to spam or guess or stir things up
```
Troutangle ≈70°

```
Just copy what this silly song shows
```
Troutangle ≈70°

After the video:

1. He winks his left eye 
2. He says: "Best of Luck!"

> Note: the words 'song' and 'silly' are switched on the last line on the subtitles. The above lyrics correspond to the words Max said.

> Note: after the line 'And that's beyond a fact', in the video, the fish turns around. This could indicate that the last 4 lines should be read in reverse, thus stating that you shouldn't do anything in the last 4 lines other than 'copy what [the] silly song shows'

## Object in the piano

Common misconception: There is also a monkey in the bottom right corner.

This is just a piano hinge.
