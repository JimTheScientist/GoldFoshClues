# Watch Details

## Connections with trout
The watch disappears when he says the words: "**trout**". This may be to lead us to the fact that it maby a trout wrist watch.

## Connections with the rotation of goldfosh

The goldfosh was found to be uniquely rotated to about 4 differnt positions.
If the original position was ≈180°, the trout can be found in these angles:

1. 180°
2. 265° - 275°
3. 0°
4. 45° - 90°

When these angles are converted into times, if 90° = 12, we get the following times (following 24HR format):

> Note: We do not know whether it is AM or PM.

1. 3 or 15
2. 5 or 17
3. 9 or 21
4. 10/11 or 22/23
