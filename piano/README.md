# Piano Lead

The text "Chappell" can be seen on the side of the piano.

A few quick observations lead to the discovery of [this website's piano listing](https://pianoz.com/piano-sale/piano/chappell-fully-restored-0)

A quick comparison can show that the piano is the same.

Visiting the [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pianoz_com/?hl=en) of the store confirms that this was the piano used in the video.

The video may have even been filmed in the same room as the listing.
