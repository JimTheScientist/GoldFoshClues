this
is a goldfish well it's a gold fosh and
it's worth quite a lot of money
certainly in the highs of the five
figures it was handmade by one of the
finest jewelers in the country
it's going to be found by one of you
it's time
for a treasure hunt
anyone of you watching this video can
win the treasure but that's for later
who made this masterpiece now you might
remember sam hello
a couple of months ago when i hit a
million subscribers sam made me some
lovely ruby and gold play buttons look
at that but this time i've given him a
slightly more difficult task i gave him
three months to hand make the most
outrageous and downright silly piece of
treasure he could possibly think of is
it in there
here we bloody go and he didn't
disappoint oh my
god presenting
the goldfosh that is more remarkable
than it could ever have been in photos
it is so
sparkly
how many individual stones are there
about 1700 18 karat yellow gold orange
sapphires white diamonds and two black
spinels unfortunately i need to give it
away and give it away i will to one
lucky member of the foshpit that's able
to solve a single clue that is coming at
the end of this video you're really
expensive but how expensive exactly well
that might not be an easy question to
answer so i had to speak to some experts
it's time to get it valued by the most
famous jewelers in london
for evaluation i visited some of the
most respected jewellery valuers in
london to hear their thoughts
oh my gosh it's absolutely beautiful
this has been beautifully made and to
make something like this i actually i'll
show you how expensive the procedure is
but when it came to valuing a piece as
unique as the gold fosh even the best of
the best we're finding it tricky do it
properly it's a lot of work yeah it's
not something you can do you're gonna
hit me like that so that's about that
nobody wants to say how much they think
it's worth
it's a special piece that's for sure so
it was time to bring in the biggest of
