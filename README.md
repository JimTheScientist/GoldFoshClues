# Misconceptions

Clearing up some misconceptions:

 - A red herring is a real clue intended to mislead people. As far as I am aware, these don't really exist.
 - A dead lead is like a red herring, but created by the hunters. This likely includes Joe Jenkins message.
 - A troll is a clue made by someone who is not related to the hunt.

## Where is the fish?

There seems to be some confusion around how to find the fish. In general, the community has some specific loose rules:

 - Do not use random leads that came from somewhere other than the main video
 - Looking in a real location is not going to be a part of the hunt. A real location may be relevant, but you do not need to travel there.
 - Spamming random people "In the name of Max Fosh, Dish out the Fish" is not going to work, even though many believe we are looking for a person.
 - Calling random people does not make sense. They must be related to some clue in the video.
