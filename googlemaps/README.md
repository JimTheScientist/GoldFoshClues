"In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish"

That’s all you need to spout

Exactly who to ask and how?

Just use my vid to find out

To claim the precious trout (Mr cod & pizza)

Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen (First Group Bus Garage)

With the possibility the world is packed (Slough)

But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max (Max Spielmann)

And that’s beyond a fact

Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice 

Post on TikTok videos? (Akaya Lounge Halal(comes up when you search TikTok))

No need to spam or guess or stir things up (Upton Lodge)

Just copy what this silly song shows
