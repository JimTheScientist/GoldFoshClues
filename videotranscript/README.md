this

is a goldfish well it's a gold fosh and

it's worth quite a lot of money

certainly in the highs of the five

figures it was handmade by one of the

finest jewelers in the country

it's going to be found by one of you

it's time

for a treasure hunt

anyone of you watching this video can

win the treasure but that's for later

who made this masterpiece now you might

remember sam hello

a couple of months ago when i hit a

million subscribers sam made me some

lovely ruby and gold play buttons look

at that but this time i've given him a

slightly more difficult task i gave him

three months to hand make the most

outrageous and downright silly piece of

treasure he could possibly think of is

it in there

here we bloody go and he didn't

disappoint oh my

god presenting

the goldfosh that is more remarkable

than it could ever have been in photos

it is so

sparkly

how many individual stones are there

about 1700 18 karat yellow gold orange

sapphires white diamonds and two black

spinels unfortunately i need to give it

away and give it away i will to one

lucky member of the foshpit that's able

to solve a single clue that is coming at

the end of this video you're really

expensive but how expensive exactly well

that might not be an easy question to

answer so i had to speak to some experts

it's time to get it valued by the most

famous jewelers in london

for evaluation i visited some of the

most respected jewellery valuers in

london to hear their thoughts

oh my gosh it's absolutely beautiful

this has been beautifully made and to

make something like this i actually i'll

show you how expensive the procedure is

but when it came to valuing a piece as

unique as the gold fosh even the best of

the best we're finding it tricky do it

properly it's a lot of work yeah it's

not something you can do you're gonna

hit me like that so that's about that

nobody wants to say how much they think

it's worth

it's a special piece that's for sure so

it was time to bring in the biggest of

guns independent fine jewelry specialist

three months but we would just love to

your initial remarks that to me is

really really fine craftsmanship to find

craftsmen today that can do this kind of

work is getting rarer and rarer i'm
