# Lyrics

```
"In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish"
```

```
That’s all you need to spout
```

```
Exactly who to ask and how?
```

```
Just use my vid to find out
```

```
To claim the precious trout
```

```
Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen
```

```
With the possibility the world is packed
```

```
But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max
```

```
And that’s beyond a fact
```

```
Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice
```

```
Post on TikTok videos?
```

```
No need to spam or guess or stir things up
```

```
Just copy what this silly song shows
```

> Note: the words 'song' and 'silly' are switched on the last line. The above lyrics correspond to the words Max said.
> Note: after the line 'And that's beyond a fact', in the video, the fish turns around. This could indicate that the last 4 lines should be read in reverse, thus stating that you shouldn't do anything in the last 4 lines other than 'copy what [the] silly song shows'
